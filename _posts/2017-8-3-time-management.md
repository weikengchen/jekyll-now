**Newton's three laws of graduation ([Ph.D. Comics 221/222/223](http://phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=221))** 

1. A grad student in procrastination tends to stay in procrastination unless _an external force_ is applied to it.

2. The age, _a_, of a doctoral process is directly proportional to the flexibility, _f_, given by the advisor and inversely proportional to the student's motivation, _m_.

3. For every action towards graduation there is an equal and opposite distraction.

**Challenge**

Ph.D. students tends to procrastinate and reduces the productivity, mostly from mental reasons, such as lack of motivation or confusion on what to do. For example, some of _us_ check emails frequently ([Ph.D. Comics 413](http://phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=413)). 

However, the road to Ph.D. is full of challenges. First-year students may fail to acknowledge at first, while:

1. Prelim comes soon.

2. Deadlines of NSDI, S&P, USENIX SEC, OSDI are not as far as you think.

3. There is a gap between undergraduate courses and graduate researches.

**Useful Resource**

I found the guideline from Berkeley Tang Center is concise and helpful:

[https://uhs.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/time_management.pdf](https://uhs.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/time_management.pdf)

For time management, I personally use:

- [Google Calendar](http://calendar.google.com/) (bCalendar) for time arrangement. By default, other people in Berkeley can see your calendar, but the block of time is labelled as "busy", therefore it does not leak the _metadata_ of what you are going to do.

- [Habitica](https://habitica.com/#/tasks) for task list. Generally, we have _in reality_ many things to do. If you forget what is waiting for you to do, then you may procastinate (e.g. forget to take quals ([Ph.D. Comics 363](http://phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=363)).

I think one big challenge in time management is the after-lunch siesta ([Ph.D. Comics 86](http://phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=86)). Some tips are: [[Luyk2015]](http://midnightjanitorial.com/news/tips-to-beat-the-need-for-a-mid-day-siesta/).
